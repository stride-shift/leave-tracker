## 📌 Important Notes

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Logging in with **dummy/demo accounts** will not provide the full experience:
> - Email confirmations will not work (requires SMTP with real Gmail).
> - For the **best experience**, log in with your **own Gmail account**.

<br>

> [!CAUTION]
>
> - The **Manage Leave Requests section is available only to Managers**.
> - Please log in with a user account that has the **Manager role**.
> - **Admins** and **Team Members** will **not** see this section.
> - Leave approvals are **done on a group basis**. Each Manager can only approve or reject leave requests for members of their **assigned group/project**.
> - Simply assigning someone as a Manager will **not** allow them to receive leave requests unless they are also a manager of a group/project.

## 📖 User Flow

1. **Team Member** applies for leave.
2. **Manager** approves/rejects the request.
   - Email confirmation is sent automatically.
3. Approved leaves appear on:

   - The shared **big calendar** inside the app
   - The user’s **Google Calendar** (if Gmail login is used)
   - Pressing on a **username** will open a popup with user details.
   - When running in Docker, clicking on the **calendar icon** will send an email containing a **Google Calendar link**.
   - Opening this link grants you permission to view live events synced with Google Calendar.
